**The truly free, self-hostable alternative to OpenRouter.ai**

FreeRouter connects your software to AI models through a unified API. Unlike other routing services, FreeRouter charges absolutely nothing on top of provider costs.

## Status: Alpha

Core functionality is WIP and things are messy! We're actively developing and welcome early adopters and contributors.

‚≠ê Star us if you believe AI infrastructure should be free and open!

## Why FreeRouter?

- **Privacy-First**: Your prompts never leave your control
- **Laravel Powered**: Built on a stable, mature PHP framework
